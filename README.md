Hello world!

Hello!

This guide exists to help you gain comfortability with drafting in general and with <a href="https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/1ipvh">my cube</a> specifically, as all card examples come from my cube.
I’m sure some of you know BREAD already, but I also think that even veteran magic players may be interested in knowing the archetypes that exist in the cube. 

If you are new to drafting, don’t be alarmed by how long this doc is, think of this as a reference guide only if you need it. Before you begin there are really only two main strategies to keep in mind while drafting the cube
Curve-fitting - for building a cohesive deck
B.R.E.A.D.(S.) - for prioritizing card selection
Good luck!
Jeremiah
