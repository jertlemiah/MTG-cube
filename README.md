Hello world!

Hello!

This guide exists to help provide comfortability with drafting in general and familiarity with <a href="https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/1ipvh">my cube</a> specifically, as all card examples come from my cube.

If you are new to drafting, donâ€™t be alarmed by how long this doc is, think of this as a reference guide only if you need it. Before you begin there are really only two main strategies to keep in mind while drafting the cube
\nCurve-fitting - for building a cohesive deck
\nB.R.E.A.D.(S.) - for prioritizing card selection
\nGood luck!
\nJeremiah
