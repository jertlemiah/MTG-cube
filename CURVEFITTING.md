Curve Fitting
The basic idea of curve fitting is:
“if you can play a 1-drop on turn 1, a 2-drop on turn 2, a 3-drop on turn 3, …, and just keep on consistently playing things, then it almost doesn’t matter what cards are in your deck”
There are two main things to think about to ensure that this happens:
Pick 1-2 colors and stick to them - the more colors you have, the harder it is to be consistent
Fill out a decent mana-curve - you need to pick cards of varying mana values to do this
Pick 1-2 Colors
This can be very hard to do when there are so many good cards in every color, but by halfway through the cube you should pick a primary and/or secondary color and stick to it. 
You can definitely still change your mind or splash, but you run the risk of not getting enough cards to make that strategy work.
The fewer colors you have, the more consistent your deck will be because you will be able to play all your cards without getting mana-screwed.
The mana-curve
A limited 40-card mana-curve roughly follows the image to the right:
15-18 lands, 25-22 non-lands
Twice as many creatures as non-creatures
Only 3-4 bombs to close out a game. 
Every deck will be different though, so it’s okay to use different numbers as long as you have a plan.

NOTE: Pure aggro is very difficult in a cube, and I would recommend against it. Mid-range decks are typically going to give the best results.

On the next page, I have included a graph of the mana curve of the total cube just to show that it roughly follows the ideal curve.


Why Curve Fitting Works
The simple answer is that I have personally designed the cube, hand-selecting every single card and trimming any cards that aren’t good enough.
I have tried to make sure that cards within a color are cohesive while following the ideal mana curve and still enabling synergies that span over 2 or 3 colors.
This strategy becomes even more powerful when you:
Use BREAD to help you select cards
Learn the Archetypes in the cube
An Archetype is basically a deck within the cube. It’s a series of cards that work together to form a cohesive strategy. There are 5-ish main Archetypes, but even more synergies between just a handful of cards
